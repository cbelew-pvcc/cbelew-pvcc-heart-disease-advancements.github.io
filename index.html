    <h1>Technology Breakthroughs for Heart Disease</h1>
    <h2>New and upcoming studies and technologies</h2>
    <h3>Outsmarting high blood pressure’s development with new drug</h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to heart disease a very crucial part to helping prevent and reducing the disease would be managing
        and keeping the blood pressure with in check. Despite all the advances in technology this field has not seen so
        much
        success. Despite all efforst on this issue only 25% of all people that have high blood pressure levels are able
        to keep there blood pressure with in
        the target range. In a effort to combat this issue researchers have been studying Zilebesiran. This is a
        investigational medication that is believed to reduce the body’s productions of angiotensinogen. By
        reducing the bodies production of this it has been found so far in current studies that people who have been
        taking this drug have shown lower blood pressure levels. This one drug has show potential to help reduce blood
        pressure and as a result will also help reduce the stress on the heart and help to reduce the potential increase
        of
        heart disease in future.

    <h3>FDA approves first treatment to reduce risk of heart issues in people who are overweight</h3>
    <p>
        The FDA has approved a new use for a drug known as Wegovy (Semaglutide) Injection and with this approval it has
        shown great
        promise in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death. Wegovy is a drug that was designed to help people lose
        weight and has also been discovered to be beneficially with people who are struggling with heart related
        illnesses. In recent polls and studies, it has been found that obesity affects around 70% of the adults in
        American.
        This has also led to an increase in a lot of health-related issues especially heart attacks. So by helping
        people maintain a healthy weight it has shown a decline in heart disease and any heart related illnesses. From
        what we can see is as we reduce ones weight it is seen to reduced the stress that is
        placed on the heart of those who are over weight.

    <h3>Imaging advances help guide stent placement in complex procedures.</h3>
    <P>
        Other research has also been conducted using Percutaneous Coronary Intervention also referred to as PCI. This
        procedure was commonly used for people that had a simple coronary artery disease. Thanks to recent studies
        it has been discovered that PCI can be used to help in many complex heart problems and espically harder to reach
        areas.
        The Ilumien IV study discovered that using PCI to help guide a procedure called Optical Coherence
        tomography. Made it way easier to see inside blood cells and to find problems that would have normally been
        easy to miss and overlook. One study also found that out of all the subjects the control group that had the
        procedure done using PCI showed that they had far fewer major cardiac events and deaths over a two-year span.

    <h3>Does living a sedentary life affect heart health?</h3>
    <p>
        To start off on this topic, did you know that since 1950 the amount of sedentary jobs
        has increased by 83%! That’s a massive increase and on top of that physical jobs now only make up 20%
        of the total workforce today. According to Erin Michos, M.D., M.H.S. all of this inactivity is taking a toll
        on everyone’s health. But to what extent? Well, if we look at a collection of large studies conducted in
        2015, we can see from the results of a variety of studies that sitting for long periods of time can be connected
        to worse health outcomes. The data shown from those studies that there was a
        increase in heart disease, but that’s not the only thing. It also showed a greater chance of diabetes,
        cancer, and even death from other health-related diseases. So, in fact living a sedentary life can and will
        increase
        your chances. Michos also says “Even if you’re doing 30 minutes per day of physical activity, it matters
        what you do the other 23 hours of the day.” So it is crucial that we try to stay as active as possible
        to ensure that we can keep our health in check.

    <h3>So where do we stand as now and what could be done as now?</h3>
    <p>
        So as we can see over the past few years there has been a lot of breakthrough in the research to hopefully
        defeat heart disease. But despite all the research that is being done we still have a long way to go to stop
        heart disease as a whole. But as we can clearly see we are making progress in the right direction. We have been
        able to find many new ways as of now to help and to be way more effective at treating and detecting the
        conditions and I hope that in the near future that we will find the magic cure to heart disease as whole. But as
        for now we can clearly see that a big factor that is contributing to this massive health issue that effects many
        people to this day is lifestyle. We have seen a massive connection with being rarely activity and weight.
        Hopefully as more research is done and more people start to pay attention. We can start to see more and more
        people advocating for the options and chances to get up and move more especially those that have a job that
        requires them to stay still for most of the day. Even those we haven’t found a cure we have found a big
        contributor and hopefully a way to reduce the amount of new cases that could pop up over the next few years.
        This could be done by hopefully encouraging and allowing people to get up more and move around more.
