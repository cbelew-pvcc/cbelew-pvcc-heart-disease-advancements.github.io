    <h3>Does living a sedentary life affect heart health?</h3>
    <p>
        To start off on this topic, did you know that since 1950 the amount of sedentary jobs
        has increased by 83%! That’s a massive increase, and on top of that, physical jobs now only make up 20%
        of the total workforce. According to Erin Michos, M.D., M.H.S. all of this inactivity is taking a toll on
        everyone’s health. But to what extent? Well, if
        we look at a collection of large studies conducted in 2015, we can see from the results that sitting for
        long periods of time can be connected to worse health outcomes. The data showed in those studies that it
        increased heart disease, but that’s not the only thing. It also showed a greater chance of diabetes,
        cancer, and death from other health-related diseases. So, living a sedentary life can and will increase
        your chances. Michos also says “Even if you’re doing 30 minutes per day of physical activity, it matters
        what you do the other 23 hours of the day.” So it is crucial that we try to stay as active as possible
        to ensure that we can keep our health in check.
