    <h1>Technology Breakthroughs for Heart Disease</h1>
    <h2>New and upcoming studies and technologies</h2>
    <h3>Outsmarting high blood pressure’s development with new drug</h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to heart disease a very crucial part to helping prevent and reducing the disease is managing
        and
        keeping blood pressure with in check. Despite all the advances in technology this field has not seen so much
        success. Only 25% of all people that have high blood pressure are able to keep there blood pressure with in
        the
        target range. In a effort to combat this issue researchers have been studying Zilebesiran. This is a
        investigational medication that is believed to reduce the body’s productions of angiotensinogen . By
        reducing
        the bodies production of this it has been found so far in the current studies that people who have been
        taking
        this drug have shown lower blood pressure levels. This one drug has show potential to help reduce blood
        pressure
        and as a result will also help reduce the stress on the heart and help elevate the potential increase of
        heart
        future heart disease
    </p>
    <h3>FDA approves first treatment to reduce risk of heart issues in people who are overweight</h3>
    <p>
        The FDA has approved a new use for Wegovy (Semaglutide) Injection and with this approval it has shown great
        promise in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death. Wegovy is a drug that was designed to help people lose
        weight and has also been discovered to be beneficially with people who are struggling with heart related
        illnesses. In recent polls and studies, it has been found that obesity affects around 70% of American adults.
        This has also led to an increase in a lot of health-related issues especially heart attacks. So, by helping
        people maintain a healthy weight it has shown a decline in heart disease for as it reduced the stress that is
        placed on the heart.

    <h3>Imaging advances help guide stent placement in complex procedures.</h3>
    <P>
        Other research has also been conducted using Percutaneous Coronary Intervention also referred as PCI. This
        procedure was commonly used for people that had a simple coronary artery disease. Thanks to recent studies
        it has been discovered that PCI can be used to help in my complex heart problems and harder to reach areas.
        The Ilumien IV study discovered that using PCI to help guide a procedure called Optical Coherence
        tomography. Made it way easier to see inside blood cells and to find problems that would have normally been
        easy to miss and overlook. One study found that out of all the subjects the control group that had the
        procedure done using PCI showed that they had few major cardiac events and deaths over a two-year span.

    <h3>Does living a sedentary life affect heart health?</h3>
    <p>
        To start off on this topic, did you know that since 1950 the amount of sedentary jobs
        has increased by 83%! That’s a massive increase, and on top of that, physical jobs now only make up 20%
        of the total workforce. According to Erin Michos, M.D., M.H.S. all of this inactivity is taking a toll
        on
        everyone’s health. But to what extent? Well, if we look at a collection of large studies conducted in
        2015, we
        can see from the results that sitting for
        long periods of time can be connected to worse health outcomes. The data showed in those studies that it
        increased heart disease, but that’s not the only thing. It also showed a greater chance of diabetes,
        cancer, and death from other health-related diseases. So, living a sedentary life can and will increase
        your chances. Michos also says “Even if you’re doing 30 minutes per day of physical activity, it matters
        what you do the other 23 hours of the day.” So it is crucial that we try to stay as active as possible
        to ensure that we can keep our health in check.
